That's an excellent point. You're suggesting a more dynamic and merit-based system, where a freelancer can earn "senior developer" status on a project-by-project basis. This makes the platform more flexible and rewards skilled freelancers with greater responsibility and authority.

Here is an updated version of the README. I have integrated this concept into the relevant sections, clarifying how a freelancer can transition into a senior role for a specific project.

Google Cloud Project (for Gemini API access)

1. Clone and Install
2. Environment Configuration
Create .env.local in your frontend directory and .env in your backend directory with your credentials:

Frontend (.env.local):

Backend (.env):

3. Database Setup (Backend)
Configure your PostgreSQL database (e.g., using Neon) and update DATABASE_URL in your backend .env file.

Run database migrations:

4. GitHub OAuth Setup
Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps.

Create a new OAuth App:

Application name: NexusWorks

Homepage URL: https://nexusworks.in (or http://localhost:3000 for local testing)

Authorization callback URL: https://nexusworks.in/auth/callback (or http://localhost:3000/auth/callback for local testing)

Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your backend .env file.

5. Stripe Setup
Create a Stripe account.

Obtain your Stripe Secret Key and Webhook Secret from the Stripe Dashboard and add them to your backend .env file.

6. Run Development Servers
Frontend:

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the frontend application.

Backend:

The backend API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
Authentication Flow
User navigates to /auth/signin or /auth/register.

Users can choose to "Sign in with GitHub" or use traditional email/password registration.

If GitHub OAuth, the user is redirected to GitHub.

GitHub redirects to /auth/callback.

Django backend exchanges the code for a session.

A user profile is auto-created or updated from GitHub data.

User is redirected to the onboarding flow or their role-specific dashboard.

Database Schema
User: Base user information and authentication details.

FreelancerProfile: Skills, experience, portfolio for freelancers.

Project: Project listings, requirements, and status.

Task: Detailed tasks with subtasks, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications.

MatchingRequest: Records of AI-powered freelancer-project matches.

Payment: Payment transactions, including escrow status.

Notification: Real-time notifications for users.

ProjectTeam: Association of users to projects with roles (client, freelancer, or senior_developer).

ProjectChat: Real-time messaging within projects.

TaskOffer: Freelancer bids/offers on tasks.

GitHubRepository: Integration details for GitHub repos.

Key Routes
/ - Public homepage.

/auth/signin - User sign-in.

/auth/register - User registration.

/auth/callback - OAuth callback handler.

/onboarding - New user setup (role selection, profile completion).

/dashboard - Role-specific dashboard (client, freelancer, admin).

/profile - User profile management.

/projects/create - Client-side project creation.

/projects/<id> - Project details and management console.

/tasks/<id> - Task details and progress tracking.

üîê Security Features
Row Level Security (RLS): Database-level access control via PostgreSQL.

Protected Routes: Middleware-based route protection for role-specific access.

Role-based Access: Different permissions and views for clients, freelancers, and administrators. A freelancer's permissions can be temporarily elevated to "Senior Developer" on a per-project basis, granting them specific editing and approval rights.

Secure File Storage: User-scoped file access and management.

Real-time Security: Authenticated real-time subscriptions for chat and updates.

Secure Session Management: Django-Login ensures robust session handling.

Password Hashing: Werkzeug used for secure password storage.

Input Validation: Comprehensive validation and sanitization to prevent common vulnerabilities.

üöÄ Deployment
General Deployment Notes
Deploy the frontend (Next.js) to platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

Deploy the backend (Django) to platforms like Render, Heroku, or a dedicated VPS.

Ensure all environment variables are correctly configured for production.

Use Gunicorn (or a similar WSGI server) for serving the Django application in production.

Netlify Deployment (Frontend)
Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.

Set environment variables in the Netlify dashboard (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL).

Deploy with build command: npm run build.

Backend Deployment
Ensure your DEBUG environment variable is set to False in production.

Use a robust WSGI server like Gunicorn: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 nexusworks.wsgi:application

Configure your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to proxy requests to the Gunicorn server.

Domain Configuration
Production: https://nexusworks.in

Staging: Configure as needed (e.g., https://staging.nexusworks.in)
