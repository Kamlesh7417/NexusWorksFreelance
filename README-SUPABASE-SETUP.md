# Supabase Database Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ How to Apply the Database Migrations

Since the Supabase CLI isn't available in this environment, you'll need to apply the migrations manually through the Supabase Dashboard.

### Step 1: Access Your Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in to your account
3. Open your project: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fvmytlubzjifwtvwfdpi`

### Step 2: Open the SQL Editor
1. In your project dashboard, click on **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"New Query"** to create a new SQL script

### Step 3: Apply Migrations in Order
Copy and paste each migration file content into the SQL Editor and run them **in this exact order**:

#### Migration 1: User Profiles
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120302_heavy_mouse.sql
```

#### Migration 2: Projects Table
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120311_quiet_snowflake.sql
```

#### Migration 3: Project Bids
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120320_silver_wind.sql
```

#### Migration 4: Messages
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120327_precious_sun.sql
```

#### Migration 5: Storage Buckets
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120333_icy_garden.sql
```

#### Migration 6: Reviews
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120342_yellow_voice.sql
```

#### Migration 7: Enable Realtime
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120349_pale_brook.sql
```

#### Migration 8: Sample Data
```sql
-- Copy the content from: supabase/migrations/20250613120351_empty_river.sql
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup
After running all migrations, verify your setup:

1. **Check Tables**: Go to **Table Editor** and confirm these tables exist:
   - `user_profiles`
   - `projects`
   - `project_bids`
   - `messages`
   - `reviews`

2. **Check Storage**: Go to **Storage** and confirm these buckets exist:
   - `project-files`
   - `avatars`
   - `portfolios`

3. **Check Realtime**: Go to **Database > Replication** and confirm realtime is enabled

### Step 5: Test the Demo
1. Visit `/supabase-demo` in your application
2. Create a test account (both client and developer)
3. Test creating projects, uploading files, and real-time updates

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If you get permission errors:
- Make sure you're signed in as the project owner
- Check that RLS policies are properly created

### If storage doesn't work:
- Verify storage buckets are created
- Check storage policies in the Storage section

### If realtime doesn't work:
- Confirm realtime is enabled for all tables
- Check browser console for connection errors
